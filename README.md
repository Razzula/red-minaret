</p>

A group of friends have gone on a trip to Agra, India. They are visiting the Taj Mahal when they hear a scream. They rush to the source of the sound and find one of the group laying on the ground, dead. Their blood is splattered against the white marble of the minarets.

This project serves as a virtual 'grimoire' for the storyteller (GM) of a custom social deduction game, largely based on the game "[Blood on the Clocktower](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/)" by The Pandemonium Institute.
